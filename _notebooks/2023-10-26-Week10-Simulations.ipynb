    "## Notes\n",
    "### Essential Knowledge:\n",
    "- Simulations are abstractions for complex objects or phenomena.\n",
    "- They mimic real-world events with simplifications.\n",
    "- Simulations are used to refine results or hypotheses.\n",
    "- They may have limitations or biases.\n",
    "- Examples include radar displays, RNG for simulating variability, and weather forecasting.\n",
    "- Car-testing simulations assume certain conditions like driver age and seatbelt use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flight Simulator:\n",
    "- Flight simulator is an example of a simulation.\n",
    "- It allows users to simulate flying real planes, choosing the plane type and location.\n",
    "- Benefits include cost savings, safety, and resource conservation.\n",
    "- Simulations save money and resources but aren't actual real-life experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vocabulary:\n",
    "- Simulation Abstraction: Errors or unusual occurrences in simulations.\n",
    "- Heuristic: an approach used when the best solution is impractical.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulations vs. Experiments:\n",
    "- Simulations mock real-world items without using the actual items.\n",
    "- Experiments involve real-world objects and equipment.\n",
    "- Simulations are often less expensive.\n",
    "- Experiments provide actual results.\n",
    "- Simulations can model impractical real-world events.\n",
    "- Experiments can be riskier and more invasive.\n",
    "- Simulations are safer and less expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithmic Efficiency:\n",
    "- It measures the fastest and least resource-dependent solution to a problem.\n",
    "- It's determined by the number of computations (steps) in an algorithm.\n",
    "- Efficiency varies with input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Algorithm Example:\n",
    "- Sorting cards with comparisons and swaps.\n",
    "- More efficient algorithms require fewer comparisons and swaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Efficiency Simply Explained:\n",
    "- Efficiency is measured by the number of steps.\n",
    "- Algorithms need to be analyzed with different input sizes.\n",
    "- Reasonable algorithms operate with polynomial efficiency.\n"

    "#### HW 2: Benefits and Negative of Using a Simulation\n",
    "- Benefit - Cost-Effective: Simulations can be much more cost-effective than conducting real-world experiments, as they don't require physical resources or expensive equipment.\n",
    "- Benefit - Safety: Simulations allow for the testing of scenarios that would be dangerous or risky in the real world, ensuring the safety of participants and valuable assets.\n",
    "- Benefit - Resource Conservation: Simulations reduce resource consumption, such as fuel or materials, which is important for environmental and economic reasons.\n",
    "- Negative - Lack of Real-Life Accuracy: Simulations may not always accurately replicate real-world conditions, leading to potential biases and limitations. They may not provide a complete understanding of complex, real-world systems, and some details might be oversimplified or overlooked."
