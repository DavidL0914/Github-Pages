## Practicing code
* Made a Javascript page to practice if conditions and other commands
* Coded a Dice game with Python that deletes your system 32 files if you roll a 1. Note to self: Never run that code.
* Note: but files are under tangibles as they were not requested to be done in the Hacks, I just wanted to do some extra practice.

## Lab Notebook Updates
* Changed theme of lab notebook to a new one
* Edited index.md to include a title, my Freeform picture, and more
* Added in a file (Linux Shell and Bash) from the teacher repository onto my Lab Notebook as proof of concept
* Began organizing all the files and customizing everything to make it uniquely my Lab Notebook
