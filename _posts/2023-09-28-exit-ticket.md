## Self Grade
Rubric:
- .5 point: Have a working HTML code cell in a notebook based on the wireframe representation provided under HTML hacks (HTML Hack)
    - I have a working HTML code cell in my notebook that follows the wireframe representation under HTML hacks
- .5 point: Have a working javascript code cell in a notebook based on the instructions provided under data types hacks (Data Types Hack)
    - My code does what the hack wants it to do, located under data types hacks
- .5 point: Have a working javascript code cell in a notebook which modifies elements in the first HTML code cell hack or another HTML code cell based on the same wireframe representation (DOM Hack)
    - I used the same code I made for the wireframe representation under HTML hacks to make this code. When you click the button, it modifies a paragraph tag and switches links. 
- .5 point: Have a working javascript code cell in a notebook based on the instructions provided in the javascript hack Javascript Hack
    - My javascript cell works and does what the hack asks it to do
- .5 point: Have code cells in a notebook which shows the corrections made to the first three code cells in the 1.4 correcting errors page (Correcting Errors Hack)
    - I corrected all 4 cells to do what they were intended to do. Under each cell I explained why I changed and how it fixes the code. 
- 1 point: Have all of the different notebooks and cells made working in their own individual GitHub Pages with utterances and reviewers comments
    - I copied the Web Programming Basic files from the teacher repository onto my TimeBox. All the hacks are under their individual page on this file in my Timebox.

## Peer Review by Shuban Pal
- HTML: "4/4, your code looks like the wireframe"
- Data Types: "Looks very organized, I like the diversity of the keys in the object"
- DOM: "Good commenting on code - I can see where everything is"
- Javascript: "The code is very simple and concise and does it job, good job"
- JS Debugging: "I like how you explained everything under 'What I Changed' and how what you changed makes the code work"
