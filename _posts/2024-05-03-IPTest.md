Answer: A - Each packet contains data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing information used for routing the data.
<br>
In data transmission, a packet is a unit of data that is transmitted over a network. It consists of a header, which contains information about the packet, such as the source and destination addresses, and a payload, which contains the actual data being transmitted. Packets are used to ensure that data is transmitted efficiently and reliably, as they can be broken down and transmitted individually, and can be reassembled at the receiving end.
