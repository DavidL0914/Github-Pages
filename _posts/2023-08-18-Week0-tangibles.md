## Tool set ups
We set up the following:
* VSCode and a lot of its extensions
* Github accounts
* Slack
* Jupyter Notebook
* WSL

## Fixing problems
We ran into a lot of problems when setting everything up:
* Austin's computer couldn't install WSL because his computer didn't have virtual machine platform enabled
    * Solution: Go to his bios mode and enable it
* Austin's files got corrupted and had to copy them from someone else's computer, but he didn't have enough storage
    * Solution: Delete non-important files and games that were hogging up his storage
* Problem with Gemfile
    * Solution: Downloaded different Gems to help it run

## Lab Notebook Updates
* Copied Github template and cloned it locally to edit and run
* Made some changes to CS page locally on VSCode to make sure localhost was running properly
