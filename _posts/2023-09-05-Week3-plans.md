## Overall goal:
Create and prepare our live Pair Showcase!
* Ask teacher for opinions on draft by Wednesday

## Requirements and plans for Pair Showcase:
* Results must have Linux and interaction in VSCode
    * Open our Timebox VSCode file using Linux, open a localhost of our Timebox file using VSCode terminal. Show it matches with our Deployed Github Pages to show everything is committed and running properly. 
* Results must have Python and interaction in VSCode
    * Code a python game in VSCode in a Jupyter Notebook file, run the cell in VSCode so it gets run on the localhost. This has Python and interaction with VSCode. 
* Results must have Web interaction in JavaScript
    * Make a file under Hacks. Code a JavaScript button that can never be clicked (or some project like that).
* Clean up everything: Make sure everything is neatly organized under Plans, hacks, and tangibles. 

## Presenting Plan
* Open up everything with Linux
* Compare localhost with Github Pages
* Go through Timebox (starting with home page, and then going over our Python and JavaScript files)
* Show how everything is neatly organized
